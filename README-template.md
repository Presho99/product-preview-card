## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media-query
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

.container{
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%)
    ;
    height: 450px;
    width: 650px;
    display: flex;
    border-radius: 10px;
    margin: 100px auto;  
}
.left{
    flex: 1;
}
.right{
    flex: 1;
    padding: 20px; 
}

### Continued development
I intend to focus more on flexbox and grid in my future projects since I am yet to grasp the concepts fully. I intend to also work on positioning of divs.

### Useful resources
- (https://css-tricks.com/left-and-right/) - This helped me understand how to use flexbox to split a div container into half.
